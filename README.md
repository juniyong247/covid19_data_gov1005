# The COVID-19 Data Project 

This is a group final project for Gov1005. The purpose of this project is to analyze the spread and impact of the coronavirus pandemic and to understand the efficacy of various policies enacted around the globe in mitigating the crisis. We seek to shed light on many different aspects of the pandemic using data visualization and statistical analysis, as well as provide commentary on the data we have. 

This repo contains:
- covid19_data_gov1005, a folder containing the Shiny app as well as all requisite datasets
- spread, a folder containing code and data specific to the "Spread" section of the app
- policy, a folder containing code and data specific to the "Policy" section of the app
- gdp, a folder containing code and data specific to the "Economic Impact" section of the app
- team_data, a folder containing extra datasets (to be cleaned)
